mentioned.<br><br>
Format<br>
Article files should be provided in Microsoft Word format. LaTex files can be used if an
accompanying PDF document is provided. PDF as a sole file type is not accepted, a PDF
must be accompanied by the source file. Acceptable figure file types are listed further
below.<br><br>
Article Length<br>
Articles should be between 3000 and 6000 words in length. This includes all text
including references and appendices. Please allow 350 words for each figure or table.<br><br>
Article Title<br>
A title of not more than 16 words should be provided.<br><br>
Author details<br>
All contributing authors’ names should be added to the paper in the correct order.<br><br>
Biographies and acknowledgements<br>
Authors who wish to include these items should save them together in an MS Word file to
be uploaded with the submission. If they are to be included, a brief professional
biography of not more than 100 words should be supplied for each named author.<br><br>
Research funding<br>
Authors must declare all sources of external research funding in their article and a
statement to this effect should appear in the Acknowledgements section. Authors should
describe the role of the funder or financial sponsor in the entire research process, from
study design to submission.<br><br>
Structured Extended Abstract<br>
Authors must supply a structured abstract in their submission, set out under 4-7 subheadings:<br>
• Purpose (mandatory)<br>
• Design/methodology/approach (mandatory)<br>
• Findings (mandatory)<br>
• Research limitations/implications (if applicable)<br>
• Practical implications (if applicable)<br>
• Social implications (if applicable)<br>
• Originality/value (mandatory)<br>
Maximum is 1000-1500 words in total (including keywords and article classification, see
below).<br>
Authors should avoid the use of personal pronouns within the structured abstract and
body of the paper (e.g. “this paper investigates…” is correct, “I investigate…” is
incorrect).<br><br>
Keywords<br>
Authors should provide appropriate and short keywords in the paper that encapsulates the
principal topics of the paper. The maximum number of keywords is 12.<br><br>

Notes or Endnotes should be used only if absolutely necessary and must be identified in
the text by consecutive numbers, enclosed in square brackets and listed at the end of the
article.<br><br>
Figures<br>
All Figures (charts, diagrams, line drawings, web pages/screenshots, and photographic
images) should be submitted in electronic form.<br>
All Figures should be of high quality, legible and numbered consecutively with arabic
numerals. Graphics may be supplied in colour to facilitate their appearance on the online
database.<br>
Figures created in MS Word, MS PowerPoint, MS Excel, Illustrator should be supplied in
their native formats. Electronic figures created in other applications should be copied
from the origination software and pasted into a blank MS Word document or saved and
imported into an MS Word document or alternatively create a .pdf file from the
origination software.<br>
Figures which cannot be supplied as above are acceptable in the standard image formats
which are: .pdf, .ai, and .eps. If you are unable to supply graphics in these formats then
please ensure they are .tif, .jpeg, or .bmp at a resolution of at least 300dpi and at least
10cm wide.<br>
To prepare web pages/screenshots simultaneously press the “Alt” and “Print screen” keys
on the keyboard, open a blank Microsoft Word document and simultaneously press “Ctrl”
and “V” to paste the image. (Capture all the contents/windows on the computer screen to
paste into MS Word, by simultaneously pressing “Ctrl” and “Print screen”.)
Photographic images should be submitted electronically and of high quality. They should
be saved as .tif or .jpeg files at a resolution of at least 300dpi and at least 10cm wide.
Digital camera settings should be set at the highest resolution/quality possible.<br><br>

displayed as footnotes to the table, figure or plate.<br><br>
References<br>
References to other publications must be in Harvard style and carefully checked for
completeness, accuracy and consistency. This is very important in an electronic
environment because it enables your readers to exploit the Reference Linking facility on
the database and link back to the works you have cited through CrossRef. You should cite
publications in the text: (Adams, 2006) using the first named author’s name or (Adams
and Brown, 2006) citing both names of two, and (Adams et al., 2006), when there are
three or more authors. At the end of the paper a reference list in alphabetical order should
